# [1.1.0](https://github.com/vantreeseba/graphql-mocks/compare/v1.0.5...v1.1.0) (2026-06-19)


### Features

* typed pools + DX options (__typename, stableIds, faker in overrides) ([7c799e5](https://github.com/vantreeseba/graphql-mocks/commit/7c799e564827d6d4e75f020e4d99c5692d270d6b))

# Unreleased

### Features

* typed pools via `buildMocks<TTypes>` / `MockResult<TTypes>` and type-aware `find()` ([7c799e5](https://github.com/vantreeseba/graphql-mocks/commit/7c799e5))
* `stableIds` option for stable `TypeName-<index>` ids ([7c799e5](https://github.com/vantreeseba/graphql-mocks/commit/7c799e5))
* override functions now receive the seeded faker instance ([7c799e5](https://github.com/vantreeseba/graphql-mocks/commit/7c799e5))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `addTypename` now defaults to `true`, so every generated object includes a `__typename` field. This is required by the Apollo cache and is the common case, but it changes object shape: exact-shape assertions and snapshots will now see an extra `__typename` key. Pass `addTypename: false` to restore the previous behavior.
